       <td> Yoga is a holistic practice that originated in ancient India and has evolved over thousands of years.
        <p>In Vira Yoga logo Hanumana is shown sitting in a yogic posture or asana, with his eyes closed in deep contemplation. This can symbolize his meditative state, although it is not as prominent as his role as a devoted servant</p>
       <p> While Lord Hanuman's meditation is not the central theme of his character in Hindu mythology, his deep devotion, unwavering focus, and profound spiritual realization make him an inspirational figure for those who practice meditation and seek to develop a deep connection with the divine. His example encourages devotees to maintain single-minded dedication and love in their spiritual pursuits.</p>

           Vira yoga, often referred to as <b>"Virayoga," </b>is a contemporary form of yoga that incorporates elements of traditional Hatha yoga and combines them with martial arts, strength training, and cardiovascular exercise. While the term "Vira" itself means "hero" or "warrior" in Sanskrit, and the practice can evoke a sense of strength and warrior-like qualities, it's not directly associated with Lord Hanuman.<p>

The inspiration for Vira yoga likely comes from a desire to promote physical fitness, strength, and mental fortitude. It emphasizes physical postures (asanas), endurance, and challenging exercises. In this context, the word "vira" reflects the idea of cultivating the qualities of a strong, determined, and disciplined individual, much like a warrior or hero.

</p> <p>However, it's essential to distinguish between Vira yoga as a contemporary exercise practice and the traditional yoga philosophy associated with Lord Hanuman's devotion or other aspects of Hindu mythology.</p> <p> While the inspiration for Vira yoga may include the imagery of a warrior or hero, it is not directly connected to Lord Hanuman's meditation or yoga practice.

Lord Hanuman's significance in the yoga and spiritual context is more related to his unwavering devotion, selfless service, and deep connection to Lord Rama, as discussed in previous responses. Vira yoga is a modern fusion of exercise and yoga techniques designed to promote physical fitness and mental strength.
